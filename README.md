Google updates Chrome with major new versions every six weeks and security patches more often than that. Chrome normally downloads updates automatically but won’t automatically restart the browser to install them. Here’s how to immediately check for updates and install them.



1. You can open Google Chrome browser on your Windows 10 computer. (Related: Fix Google Chrome won’t open)

2. Click the three-dot icon that top-right corner, and select Update Google Chrome.

Need to mention that if you don’t see the Update Google Chrome option, then your computer may already has installed the latest version of Google Chrome.

If you don’t see the Update Google Chrome button, you can alternatively click Help -> About Google Chrome after clicking the three-dot menu icon. And Google Chrome will automatically check and install the new update. Let Google Chrome complete the updating.

 3. Restart Google Chrome to finish the Chrome new update.
